# Everything you need to know about DevOps for Raspberry Pi
Ever put your Raspberry Pi inside a robot and wanted to be able to still develop without plugging it into a monitor? Have you had more than one raspberry pi that you wanted to update at once? Have two developers wanted access to one raspberry pi at the same time? If any of these situations are familiar to you or your team, you could benefit from DevOps for Raspberry Pi. In this tutorial series, we will be exploring how to automate Raspberry Pis through a software development technique called continuous integration.

We will be looking at how to get quickly started with setting up an automation server, how to communicate with a Raspberry Pi, how to successfully monitor them and update software.
